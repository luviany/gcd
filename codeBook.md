## CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


- trainData <- reading data from X_train.txt
- trainLabels <- reading from y_train.txt
- trainSubject <- read from subject_train.txt

- testData <- reading from test.txt
- testLabels <- reading from y_test.txt  
- testSubject <- reading from subject_test.txt

- mergedAll <- combined dataset from all files above


- featureNames <- reading from features.txt
- names(mergedAll)[3:563] <- featureNames ## variables names while protecting the first two colums 

- mergedAllExtracted <- this dataset contains the values in mergedAll that match mean(average) or std(standard deviation)

- activityLabels <- reading from activity_labels.txt

- mergedAllExtracted$label <- activityLabels[mergedAllExtracted$label, 2] ##adding the labels to activity column

- looking for various patters and replacing them in the variable names to make them easier to read

- descriptiveName  <- contains the list of variable names to be transformed and injected back into the dataset

-- patterns:
-- pattern="BodyBody",replacement="Body", 
-- pattern="^t",replacement="time", 
-- pattern="^f",replacement="freq", 
-- pattern="-?std[()][)]-?",replacement="Std"
-- pattern="-?mean[(][)]-?",replacement="Mean"


- tidyDataSetAverages <- copy of mergedAllExtracted dataset
- finding the mean for each group (.SD) organised by (and excluding ) label and subject
- tidyDataSetAverages <- tidyDataSetAverages[,lapply(.SD,mean), by = "label,subject"] 

- writing the requiered file to the working directory
write.table(tidyDataSetAverages, "tidyDataSet.txt", row.names = FALSE, sep = ",")

Thank you!
